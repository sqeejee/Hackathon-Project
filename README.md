This was the project @awesel and I won our schools hackathon with!

It is a guessing game, where users guess the prompt for an image generated with ai.
Their guesses will be scored 1-100, based on how close their entire phrase was in semantic similarity to the actual prompt

This project involved us merging all our previous nodejs knowledge and learning how to use NLPCloud

A super fun project and awesome learning experience!!
